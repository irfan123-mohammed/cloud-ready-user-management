With this script, you can:
- ✅ Create new users with passwords  
- ✅ Assign users to existing groups  
- ✅ Delete users (with confirmation for safety)  
- ✅ List all system users  
- ✅ Lock and unlock user accounts  

By automating these repetitive tasks, this script saves time and reduces human error.

## 🎯 Why This Project is Important
In real-world cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.), user management is a **daily responsibility**.  
For example:
- **Cloud Support Associates** often troubleshoot login issues (locked accounts, password resets).  
- **System Administrators** must ensure users are correctly added to groups with the right permissions.  
- **DevOps Engineers** automate repetitive administrative tasks to improve productivity.  

This project demonstrates:
- Strong **Linux administration** skills  
- Knowledge of **Bash scripting & automation**  
- Awareness of **security best practices** (root check, password handling, confirmation prompts)
